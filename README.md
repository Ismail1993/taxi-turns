# taxi-turns
Taxis of Kharagpur are famous for making sharp turns. You are given the coordinates where a particular taxi was on a 2-D planes at N different moments: (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN). In between these coordinates, the taxi moves on a straight line. A turn at the i-th (2 ≤ i ≤ N-1) coordinate is said to be a sharp turn if the angle by which it turns at Point B = (xi, yi) when going from coordinates A = (xi-1, yi-1) to C = (xi+1, yi+1) via (xi, yi) is greater than 45 degrees. ie. suppose you extend the line segment AB further till a point D, then the angle DBC would be greater than 45 degrees.

You have to identify whether the taxi made a sharp turn somewhere or not (Please look at Output section for details). If it made a sharp turn, also identify whether it is possible to change the coordinates at one of the N moments to make sure that the taxi doesn't make any sharp turn. Note that all the N pairs of coordinates (including the new coordinates) should be integers and distinct and should have their x and y coordinates at least 0 and at most 50.
